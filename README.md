# Caelum-Engine
Caelum-Engine is a 3D multiplatform game-engine for Windows &amp; Linux. (3D Rendering, Input, Physics, Sound, NetWork)

I developed this as my Final Year Computer Science Project in order to dive into the world of game development and understand game engines from its design perspective.
